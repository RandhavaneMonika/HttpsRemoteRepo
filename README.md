# What is this?

This tiny program lets you migrate work items from an ibm RTC server to another issue tracker like Jira or Bitbucket.

# Basic concept
Rtc2jira basically does two things:
- Import work items from a given RTC installation
- Exports this work items to one or more destinations
- this line is added at last
